# Hack-A-Thors
Problem Statement:-

Part 1 - Many students who are willing to participate in hackathons despite having the tech stack skills and knowledge of theme/ domain, are unable to bring up innovative project idea topics to solve some problems.

Part 2 - Any student who wants to explore a particular CS domain/ techstack would love to see what latest problems solved/ projects build in this domain by students around the country.

Solution:-
A website which lists out hackathon winning/ starred projects from hackathons happening around the country, month wise. The listing of projects will be done in the following manner:-

-> Top 10 projects - overall 
In this section, top 10 hackathon winning/starred projects of each month will be listed.

-> Top 10 projects - domain wise
In this section, every domain like WD, AD, ML, Blockchain, Web3, etc. will have corresponding top 10 list of hackathon winning/ starred projects, month wise.

-> Top 10 projects - theme wise
In this section, every theme like Healthcare, Education, Environment, Finance, etc. will have corresponding top 10 list of hackathon winning/ starred projects, month wise.

Every project will have corresponding information:-

->Problem statement of the project

->Solution presented 

->Techstacks used in the project

->Further improvements/ potential of the project

->About the hackathon and developers of the project.

The website will update a new list every first week of the month with data of top10 list in each category from hackathons happening around the country. This will inspire the students and help them keep up with the latest innovations brought up in the tech by students.
This website will not only give project ideas to students for their next hackathon but also inspire the students with the latest ongoing projects in each domains.
